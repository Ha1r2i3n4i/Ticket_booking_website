# Ticket Booking Website

## Overview
This is a **Ticket Booking Website** prototype built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It enables users to browse and book tickets—simulated via UI and back-end logic—making this suitable for learning, demos, or as a project starter.

## Features
- **Responsive UI**: Built with HTML and CSS for clean, intuitive layout.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: JavaScript (via `script.js`) handles real-time UI updates (e.g., form validation, button behavior).
- **Server-side Handling**: `index.php` simulates booking processing like form submission and server responses.
- **Multiple Pages**: Includes `index.html` for home, `index2.html` for alternate views, and the PHP-powered booking page.
